## ⚙️ Development Methodology

### **Agile Implementation**

The project was developed using a disciplined **Agile (Scrum)** approach:

- **Sprint 0: Architecture & Foundation**: Selection of Vite for 300ms HMR and Shadcn UI for atomic design patterns.
- **Sprint 1: Core Engine**: Implementation of the Matrix rain canvas and the custom Terminal CLI.
- **Sprint 2: Integration Phase**: Connecting GitHub contribution graphs and building the dynamic project grid.
- **Sprint 3: Polish & UX**: Adding sound effects (`useSoundEffects`), haptic-like interactions, and responsiveness audits.
- **Sprint 4: Interactive Project Cards**: Engineered the split-zone cursor-following hover badge system and full mobile/tablet optimisation pass.
- **Sprint 5: Cross-Device Matrix Rain**: Extended Matrix rain to all screen sizes with a three-tier performance model and GPU compositing.

### **Engineering Challenges & Feedback Loops**

- **Performance**: Tiered the Matrix canvas to run at 15/20/33fps across phone, tablet and desktop — no single frame budget exceeded.
- **Interactive CLI**: Designed a custom parser for the terminal to simulate a real shell environment.
- **Touch UX**: Rebuilt project card CTAs as 48px WCAG-compliant touch targets with neobrutalist press animations.

| **Interactive Terminal**     | CLI-based profile navigation                                         | A command parser supporting `help`, `about`, `projects`, and `clear`.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Project Showcase**         | Dynamic filtering of 11 projects                                     | Neo-Brutalist cards with 3D-shadow hover effects and category badges. Tags capped at 5 on phones, 8 on larger screens.                                                                                                                      |
| **GitHub Integration**       | Real-time activity visualization                                     | Uses `react-github-calendar` to demonstrate consistency and commitment.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Sound System**             | Haptic-like audio feedback                                           | Custom `useSoundEffects` hook for premium click and hover interactions.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Pixel Particle Assembly**  | Hero name assembled from scattered edge particles on desktop         | 90-particle Canvas API animation with easeOutQuart interpolation. Skipped on mobile — replaced with smooth fade + scramble text.                                                                                                            |
| **CRT Scanline Overlay**     | Retro pixel scanline on project card hover                           | CSS `repeating-linear-gradient` + keyframe sweep, disabled on touch devices.                                                                                                                                                                |

## 📊 Engineering Decisions

- **Why Vite?**: Near-instant server starts and optimized production bundles vs CRA.
- **Why Neo-Brutalism?**: To stand out from generic portfolios — bold strokes, high contrast, and raw layouts convey engineering confidence.
- **Why raw Canvas API for Matrix Rain?**: Library abstractions add overhead. Direct `ctx.fillRect` / `ctx.fillText` with a timestamped FPS throttle gives precise control over CPU budget per device class.
- **Why cursor-following badge instead of full-card overlay?**: Card content (title, description, tags) remains fully readable at all times. The badge provides contextual intent without blocking information.
- **Scalability**: All data is centralized in `src/data/constants.ts`, allowing profile updates in seconds without touching component logic.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels throughout Terminal and forms, 48px+ touch targets, keyboard-focus fallback for project card CTAs.

## 📱 Responsive & Performance Strategy

### Device Tiers

| Breakpoint          | Matrix Rain                                  | Card Hover          | Touch Buttons   |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- |
| Phone `≤480px`      | 12 cols · 15fps · Katakana+01 · 35% opacity  | Hidden (touch)      | 46px min-height |
| Tablet `481–1024px` | 20 cols · 20fps · mixed chars · 45% opacity  | Hidden (touch)      | 50px min-height |
| Desktop `>1024px`   | Auto cols · 33fps · full ASCII · 60% opacity | Cursor badge active | Buttons hidden  |

### Canvas Performance

- `{ alpha: false }` — eliminates per-pixel alpha compositing
- `will-change: transform` + `contain: strict` — GPU layer promotion
- `transform: translateZ(0)` — WebKit compositing force
- `IntersectionObserver` — animation pauses when hero scrolls out of view
- `visibilitychange` — animation pauses when browser tab is backgrounded
- `passive: true` on resize — never blocks scroll thread

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- **Responsive Design**: Verified across iPhone SE, iPhone 15 Pro, iPad, and 4K displays.
- **Cross-Browser**: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **Performance**: 95+ Lighthouse scores for SEO and Accessibility.
- **Validations**: Form inputs managed with Zod schemas for strict data integrity.
